# PulseChain Testnet Monitoring Setup Helper Script - Grafana and Prometheus
#
# Description
# - Installs Grafana and Prometheus monitoring tools on your validator server,
# however requires some manual setup and configuration afterwards (see below).
#
# Environment
# - Tested on Ubuntu 22.04
#
# What you need to do AFTER running this script
# - Check if the monitoring services are running correctly
#
# $ sudo systemctl status grafana-server.service prometheus.service prometheus-node-exporter.service
#
# - Set up the dashboards through the web interface
#
# How to access Grafana from your web browser (without exposing port 3000 to the Internet)
# $ ssh -i key.pem -N ubuntu@validator-server-IP -L 8080:localhost:3000

#
# Important Note
#
# The standard config assumes you are not sharing the validator server with other people (local user accounts).
# otherwise, itâ€™s recommended for security reasons to set up further authentication on the monitoring services.
# TL;DR you should be the only one with remote access to your validator server, so ensure your keys and passwords are
# safe and do not share them with anyone for any reason.
